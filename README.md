# odin-recipes
first odin project !
i'll look at this later and laugh :>
first of all i will be using what i learned about html to make a website about my fav recipes 
with picters and a page for every recipe 
it probably gonna look ugly since it's just html , i'll come back after i learn sm css
i'm strugling with git command and sub-commands but again practice makes perfect !
